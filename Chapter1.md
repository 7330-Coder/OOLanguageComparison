## Why was the language created?
Python was firstly implemented by Gudio Van Rossum in December 1989. To keep programming during the winter break, Van Rossum decided to develop an interpreter for a new scripting language as a descendant of another programming language ABC.

## What problems was the language trying to address?
There are some features Python wants to address.

- Extensible
	
    The highly extensibility of Python has made it popular as it provide approach to add programmable interfaces to existing applications.
    
- Reuseable
	
    Python is a fully object-oriented language. Functions, modules, numbers and et. are all objects and it supports inheritance, overloading, derivation and multiple inheritance. This is benificial to enhance the reusability of source code.
    
- Dynamic-typed

	Python is a dynamic-typed language and there is no compilation during development. It can change its structure during execution. New functions, objects, or even code can be introduced while existing functions can be deleted or structures can be changed.


## Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Van Rossum created Python as a descendant of ABC. ABC is not mean to be a programming language but a language for teaching or prototping.  However, since it is not open source, which lose the attraction to let people use it widely. Also, Python do not have all of its functionality built into its core and gains extensibility, while ABC espoused the opposite approach.
