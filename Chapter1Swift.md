# Chapter 1 : Language Purpose and Genesis



### Why was the language created?
Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Basically, Swift is a programming language that gathers features of a lot of most advanced programming language, like Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C# and CLU. The purpose for Apple to publish this programming language is to take over the position of main stream languages, can be a substitute product of C-family programming languages.


### What problems was the language trying to address?

Swift cares more on security, it makes sure more errors are detected before compiling. So, the developer may feel limited at first, but the standard of syntax ensures the quality and robustness. In addition, Swiftâ€™s performance is comparable to these languages in most tasks. The performance also has to be consistent and predictable, not just for short bursts that would require a a lot of work later on. And Expressive-Swift offers a syntax that is easy to use and has the features that most developers expect. Even now the languages advancements are being are being monitored, which means that swift is continuously evolving.

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Objective-C, C, C++
